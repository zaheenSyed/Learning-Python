# LeetCode Notebooks — Data Structures & Algorithms

Repository of Jupyter notebooks that collect problem statements, solutions, and analysis organized by data structure and algorithm topic.

## Goal
- Create one notebook per data structure or algorithm topic.
- For each notebook: include problem statement(s), solved examples, explanation, complexity analysis, and working Python solutions.
- Use notebooks as a study/reference collection and to track progress solving LeetCode problems.


## Notebook template (recommended sections)
- Title + metadata (source, difficulty, tags)
- Problem statement (copied or paraphrased with attribution/link)
- Example(s) and expected output
- Approach / intuition (text + diagrams if useful)
- Pseudocode (optional)
- Python implementation(s) — clean, tested
- Complexity analysis (time, space)
- Edge cases & tests
- References (links)

Example markdown header to include at top of each notebook:
```
# Reverse Linked List
- Source: LeetCode 206 (https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)
- Difficulty: Easy
- Tags: linked-list, recursion, iterative
```

## Tools & environment
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Recommended packages (for testing/visualization): pytest, numpy, matplotlib
- Use virtualenv or conda to manage environment.

## How to run
- Open the repository in JupyterLab or VS Code
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (optional)
- Run notebooks interactively and validate solutions with included test cells.

## Licensing & attribution
- Keep problem statements brief and include a link to the original source (LeetCode).
- Add a LICENSE file for code reuse (MIT suggested) and respect LeetCode terms.

## Tips
- Add small, reproducible test cells for each solution.
- Use diagrams (assets/) to illustrate tricky approaches.
- Tag notebooks with difficulty and key algorithm names to ease searching.

Use this README as a living document; update as the collection grows.
